## ⚖️ ClearClause 
Making Legal Contracts Legible for Everyone.

ClearClause is a premium AI-powered legal document analyzer designed to strip away "legalese" and expose hidden risks. We provide a privacy-first, instant audit of your contracts so you can sign with confidence.

## 🛑 The Problem
Legal documents are intentionally complex. Most people sign contracts without fully understanding them because:

Hidden Risks: Unfair "Limitation of Liability" or "Termination" clauses are buried in fine print.

Costly Advice: Consulting a lawyer for every minor document is expensive and slow.

Privacy Concerns: Existing AI tools often store your sensitive documents to train their models.

## ✅ The Solution
ClearClause solves this by providing a high-speed, AI-driven "risk radar" that:

Categorizes Risk: Instantly flags clauses as "High Risk" (Red), "Medium Risk" (Orange), or "Secure" (Green).

Privacy-First Architecture: Operates on a non-retention basis. Your documents are processed in real-time and deleted the moment you close the session.

Accessibility: Translates complex legal jargon into plain English summaries.

## ✨ Core Features
Smart PDF Analysis: Drag-and-drop PDF files for instant scanning.

AI Risk Radar: Visual breakdown of ambiguous terms and unfair clauses.

Premium UI/UX: A minimalist, "Sora-inspired" interface optimized for both mobile and laptop 

Secure Auth: Firebase-backed user accounts to manage your profile.

## 📱 Design Philosophy: Mobile-First
ClearClause is built for the modern user.We intentionally prioritized the **mobile experience** 
to ensure that document analysis is accessible during meetings, at signing tables, or on the move.
While we support laptop views, the most "premium" and polished experience is found on mobile devices.
